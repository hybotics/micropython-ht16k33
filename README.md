Micropython Library for the HT16K33-based LED Matrices, ported from Adafruit's
Adafruit_CircuitPython_HT16K33 library.

It supports Adafruit's 16x8 and 8x8 matrices, as well as 7-segment numeric and
  14-segment alphanumeric displays (tested).

The code for the matrix displays are here and *should* just work. However, I can
  not test these because I do not have any of these displays.

NOTE: At this time, only the 14-segment alphanumeric and 7-segment numeric displays
  have been tested. Others *may* work but have not been tested. Be warned!
